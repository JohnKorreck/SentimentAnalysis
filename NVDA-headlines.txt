Why Biden's China tariffs may not be so bad for US chip demand The Biden administration has enacted a new set of tariffs against China that will hit up to $18 billion in imported goods, including quadrupling the duties imposed on electric vehicles (EVs) and doubling tariffs on solar panels and semiconductors to 50% each. Bernstein Managing Director and Senior Analyst Stacy Rasgon joins The Morning Brief to elaborate on whether or not these trade policies will have any lasting effects on the United States, its demand for semiconductor imports, and the new avenues China is approaching to acquire more AI chips. "The US just doesn't import a lot of direct semiconductors from China... it's maybe a few billion dollars, it's not any more than that. So there's no direct impact," Rasgon says. "Now the indirect impact, you know again risks of further escalation... like counter like actions from China... those have been the issues that we've been dealing with over the last several years. By and large, they have been manageable." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.
